# Grocery Analyzer

## The following application keeps track of the number of unique items in a grocery basket and outs the count of either a single or the entire basket file. It also displays a historgam of the itme frequences for data visualization . 

## The way utiliy functions make use of HashMap, data object and the auto type is something I handeled well.

## A good way to imporve the program would be to have an actual backend where the application can coomunicate with a database and store records of item count or histogram in it.

## Using OOP and have my object be stored in a HashMap, that was challenging. Resources online helped in implementing the data structure

## The knowledge of using HashMaps and type inference is going to be very useful in future projects.

## The code has various inline comments and the repo has a documentation for redability. The classes and utility functions are modular, hence streamlines the process of adding more features.
